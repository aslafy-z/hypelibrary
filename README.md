# Hype Library CDN

This repo contains files required to roll your own content delivery network for Hype's runtime libraries. To learn more about this feature in Tumult Hype, [visit this page](http://tumult.com/hype/documentation/3.0/#external-runtime-hosting). 

This CDN example is currently hosted at [https://hypelibrary.rememberi.es](https://hypelibrary.rememberi.es).

Whenever Tumult Hype is updated, a new runtime is generated, so your CDN will need to be updated as well. All versions can be found in the Version History section at [http://tumult.com/hype/documentation/](http://tumult.com/hype/documentation/). 

The best way to be notified when a new Tumult Hype version is updated is by [joining the mailing list](http://tumult.com/hype/#social-signups).
